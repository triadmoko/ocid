# Example React OIDC Application

This repository uses [oidc-react](https://github.com/bjerkio/oidc-react). It serves as an example of how to implement `oidc-react` with the `implicit` flow.

PS: Don't use `implicit`. Let Torsten Lodderstedt tell you [why you should stop using the OAuth implicit grant!](https://medium.com/oauth-2/why-you-should-stop-using-the-oauth-implicit-grant-2436ced1c926)

See this example here: https://cobraz.github.io/example-oidc-react
